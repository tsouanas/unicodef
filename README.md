# unicodef

Mostly [ThaTeX] influenced unicode sequences for use in XCompose, vimrc, etc.



## Sequences and their expansions

See [unicodef.md] for a list of all sequences defined and the corresponding expansions.


## Installation

**tl;dr:** Just place `build/XCompose-unicodef` and `build/unicodef.vim` in the appropriate places and you're good to go.  No other file is needed.

### for X
Place `XCompose-unicodef` somewhere (for example, in `~/.unicodef`) and have your `.XCompose` include it:
```
include "%H/.unicodef/XCompose-unicodef"
```
In case you are not using a `.XCompose` file already, there is one provided in `examples/`.

Note that some programs might ignore `~/.XCompose`.  Hopefully you can make them behave by setting the environmental variables `$GTK_IM_MODULE` and `$QT_IM_MODULE` to `xim`.  For example, if you are using a sh-like shell:
```
export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
export QT_IM_MODULE=xim
```

### for Vim
Place `unicodef.vim` somewhere (for example, in `~/.unicodef`) and have your `.vimrc` source it:
```
source ~/.unicodef/unicodef.vim
```


## Usage

### in X
**Prefix** each sequence by <kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>AltGr</kbd>.  
Typing <kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>AltGr</kbd><kbd>n</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>s</kbd> should simply write `ℕ`.

### in Vim
**Prefix** each sequence by <kbd>\\</kbd><kbd>\\</kbd>.  
In INSERT MODE typing something like `f : \\nats \\to \\nats` you get `f : ℕ → ℕ`.


## Making

The needed files are generated by `mkunicodef.sh` in `src` which consults the [defs] table.

It creates the following files in `build/`:

* `XCompose-unicodef`
* `unicodef.vim`
* `defs.seq`
* `defs.exp`

The files `defs.seq` and `defs.exp` hold the sequences and their expansions respectively.  Although not needed anywhere, they might be useful.

Using make(1):

* `make` runs `mkunicodef.sh`
* `make install` copies the useful generated files to `~/.unicodef`;
* `make clean` removes the probably useless generated files;
* `make cleanall` removes *all* generated files.
